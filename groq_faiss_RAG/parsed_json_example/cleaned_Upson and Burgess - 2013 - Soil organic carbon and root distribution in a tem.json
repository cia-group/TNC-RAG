                "Methods A poplar ( Populus sp.) silvoarable agroforestry experiment including arable controls was established on arable land in lowland England in 1992. The trees were intercropped with an arable rotation or bare fallow for the first 11 years, thereafter grass was allowed to establish. Coarse and fine root distributions (to depths of up to 1.5 m and up to 5 m from the trees) were measured in 1996, 2003, and 2011. The amount and type of soil carbon to 1.5 m depth was also measured in 2011.",
                "Results The trees, initially surrounded by arable crops rather than fallow, had a deeper coarse root distribution with less lateral expansion. In 2011, the combined length of tree and understorey vegetation roots was greater in the agroforestry treatments than the control, at depths below 0.9 m. Between 0 and 1.5 m depth, the fine root carbon in the agroforestry treatment (2.56 t ha -1 ) was 79% greater than that in the control (1.43 t ha -1 ). Although the soil organic carbon in the top 0.6 m under the trees (161 t C ha -1 ) was greater than in the control (142 t C ha -1 ), a tendency for smaller soil carbon levels beneath the trees at lower",

                "Society is facing the challenge of how to increase food production, in the context of a rising world population, whilst also reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By 2020, the United Nations Environment Program (2011) has calculated that annual global greenhouse gas emissions need to decline from an anticipated 56 Gt CO2e, under a business as usual scenario, to 44 Gt CO2e to keep the mean global temperature increases beneath the target of 2°C. It has been estimated that between 2.4 and 8.5 Gt CO2e of this reduction can be derived from changes in agricultural and forestry management. This includes ' enhancing carbon sequestration by undertaking afforestation and agroforestry projects ' (UNEP 2011).",
                "Agroforestry systems are of particular interest because they combine the potential to increase carbon sequestration (Pandey 2002; Montagnini 2004; Nair et",
                "al. 2009) whilst maintaining agricultural production. Although biomass accumulation aboveground is an obvious result of introducing trees into agricultural systems, the carbon stored is relatively labile (Janzen 2005), and dependent on the fate of the products derived from woody biomass. On the other hand, carbon accumulated in the soil can persist for millennia (Rumpel et al. 2002, Schöning and KögelKnabner 2006) and forms the largest terrestrial carbon pool (Batjes 1996).",
                "The dominant pathway for carbon to enter the soil is through fine root turnover; which has been estimated to account for a third of global annual net primary productivity (Jackson et al. 1997). Agroforestry systems may be expected to increase soil carbon storage by increasing the depth to which roots are present in the system, by continually turning over fine roots throughout the year (albeit at a slower rate in the dormant season (Black et al. 1998)), and by the inclusion of recalcitrant compounds which slow the rate of mineralisation (Recous et al. 2008). Any consideration of changes in gravimetric soil organic carbon (SOC) must also take into account changes in soil bulk density which may occur as a result of different management regimes (Nair 2011).",
                "Whilst there are several studies of temperate agroforestry systems, most consider soil carbon at depths of less than 0.5 m (Bambrick et al. 2010; Peichl et al. 2006; Oelbermann and Voroney, 2007; Gordon et al. 2006; Sharrow and Ismail 2004). In this study we attempt to quantify the impact of introducing trees into arable systems on the distribution of roots and soil organic carbon to a depth of 1.5 m."

(2005), was established in 1992 on a level 4.5 ha arable field on the Cranfield University Experimental Station at Silsoe, Bedfordshire, England (lat. 52°0 ′ N, long. 0°26 W; altitude: 60 m). ′ The soil (of the Holdenby series) is categorised as a clay to a depth of more than 1.5 m, and a soil texture analysis shows a composition of 55% clay (< 2 μ m), 26% sand (2 -63 μ m) and 19% sand (63 -200 μ m) and some stones (Ashby 2001). Because of the clay mineralogy, the soil shows a marked level of swelling and shrinkage in",

                "The northern and eastern parts of the field were maintained as control areas. In the rest of the field, a 2.5 ha area of poplars was planted in April 1992 comprising three replicated blocks including each combination of four poplar hybrids and three agroforestry cropping treatments. The poplars were planted at an interval of 6.4 m along rows, aligned in an approximately north -south direction; each poplar hybrid planted as a contiguous group of five trees, with a guard tree (buffer) at the end of each row (Fig. 1). Rows were spaced 10 m apart, and comprised an uncultivated 2 m strip at the base of the trees and an 8 m wide strip that was ploughed each autumn. The poplars were planted as 1.5 -2.0 m unrooted sets to a depth of 0.6 m, into a 1.5 m wide polythene-film mulch extending along the tree rows; the edges were mechanically buried under the soil to leave an exposed strip of plastic 1-m-wide. This was maintained until the end of 1999, when the polythene was removed and a grass-clover tree-strip was sown by hand.",
                "Each replicate block included three pairs of alleys each with a central measurement tree row. The alleys adjacent to these measurement rows were then allocated to three cropping treatments: i) ' agroforestrycropped , ii) ' ' agroforestry-fallow ' and iii) an alternating treatment, which is not considered further in this paper. From 1992 to 2003, the control areas and each of the alleys were ploughed on an annual basis. An arable crop was then established in the control and cropped agroforestry treatment, with the exception of 2001, when waterlogging meant that all treatments were maintained as a bare-fallow (Table 1). The arable crops were conventionally managed and harvested receiving fertiliser and agrochemicals as appropriate. The last arable crop (spring beans) was planted and harvested in 2003. From 2004 to 2011 all of the agroforestry and control areas remained uncultivated and a grass sward was allowed to establish naturally.",
                "The poplars were pruned during the autumns of 1993, 1995, 1997, 1998 and 2000; with the aim of achieving a clear bole to a height of about 8 m. Waste arising from pruning was removed from the experimental area. In June 2011, the Beaupré poplars had",

Because the coarse root count data were highly skewed and did not satisfy the assumption of normality; the ' Kruskal-Wallis ' test (Conover 1971) implemented in the ' agricolae ' package (de Mendiburu 2010) was used to make pairwise comparisons of the count of roots found at each depth and distance for each year and treatment. Depth and distance were analysed separately for simplicity, and independently for each year.

At each distance, samples were taken at depths of 15, 45, 75, 105, and 135 cm. Samples were suspended in 3 l of water for 24 h, then washed by hand and poured through a fine mesh sieve (710 μ m). In June 2011, a second set of undisturbed soil cores (of volume 146 cm ) were taken 3 at the same distances and depths from six different sample trees, and at six control plots (with two at the same latitude of each block).

Fine root mass and length density were determined by dividing total length and mass by the volume of the sample. The cumulative carbon with depth was calculated by taking the mean fine root mass density (mg cm -3 ) for each treatment at each depth and multiplying it by an assumed increment depth of 30 cm with each sampling point at its centre (0 -30, 30 -60, 60 -90, 90 -120, and 120 -50 cm).

Six samples were taken at five distances from each sampled tree (0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 m), perpendicular to the tree row. An associated bulk density sample was taken at each sampling point, following the methods of Klute (1986). Corresponding samples were also taken at the same depths from the same six control positions used for fine root length measurements. All 216 soil samples were analysed for gravimetric soil organic carbon using a modified Walkley-Black method (British Standards Institute 1990). In order to allow future comparisons with soil organic carbon contents derived from other techniques, 27 samples (9 samples from each treatment) were also analysed using a Vario EL III Elemental Analyser (Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH, Donaustrasse, Germany). The results from the elemental analyser were within 3% of the results from the titration method.",

Mulia and Dupraz (2006) found a similar distribution of fine tree roots with depth within a 7 -9 year-old poplaragroforestry experiment in southern France. Nineteen years after planting (2011), and following the development of a naturally regenerating grass sward from 2003, the cessation of annual cultivation meant that the tree roots could colonise the surface layers. However, at least in the fallow treatment, the greatest concentration of roots continued to occur at a depth of 20 -40 cm, perhaps as a result of competition from the perennial grass crop."

Generally the arable crop established in the preceding autumn, was able to develop an extensive root system to extract substantial quantities of water before the leaves of the deciduous poplar had reached maximum area (Burgess et al., 2005).

The lack of a difference between the agroforestry and the control at this depth indicates a high presence of grass roots.

They attribute increased bulk density beneath trees to both compression of the soil exerted by root growth, and lower soil moisture content caused by increased water uptake by trees. Whilst the former is unlikely, the latter effect may have occurred at this site, where the soil is also a cracking clay effect may have occurred at this site, where the soil is also a cracking clay.

                "Although this experiment did not measure fine root turnover, it was assumed that increased fine root turnover due to the presence of the trees would increase soil organic matter. The measurement of the different soil fractions in both the agroforestry-cropped and the control treatments certainly indicates that the proportion of labile carbon was greatest at shallow depths (5 and 30 cm), coinciding with the greatest levels of fine roots in both treatments and coarse roots in the agroforestry treatment.",
                "Within the top 20 cm, there was no significant effect of the trees on the soil carbon content. This could partly be explained by the ploughing that occurred to this approximate depth for each of the first 11 years of the experiment, and the associated disaggregation and mineralisation of organo-mineral complexes. By contrast, between 20 and 40 cm, the gravimetric soil organic carbon under the trees (1.95 g 100 g -1 ) was 33% greater than that (1.47 g 100 g -1 ) in the arable control. This corresponds to the depth with the greatest quantity of coarse roots. Had the coarse roots been included in the soil carbon measurement, the total carbon content (soil+ plant) within the soil at this depth increment would be even higher.",
                "Similar results have been found with another 19 year old poplar based agroforestry experiment in Canada. Gordon et al. (2006) report that within the top 5 cm, the gravimetric soil organic carbon (2.3 g 100 g -1 ) in an agroforestry system with 111 trees ha -1 was similar to that (2.2 g 100 g -1 ) in the arable control. However a study at the same site to a greater depth of 20 cm indicated a greater ( p <0.05) organic carbon in the agroforestry system (3.0 g 100 g -1 ) than a barley monoculture (2.4 g 100 g -1 , Peichl et al. 2006).",
                "Below 90 cm, the fine root length density in the agroforestry plot was greater ( p <0.05) than the arable control; however, there was not an increase in gravimetric or volumetric soil organic carbon. In fact, there was a tendency for less soil organic carbon to be detected in the agroforestry treatment beneath 60 cm. This fact is illustrated by the lack of difference in cumulative volumetric SOC below 60 cm ( p >0.05, Table 8). These results imply that sampling to a depth of 20 cm would indicate no effect of the trees, sampling to 60 cm would indicate a benefit from trees, and sampling to 150 cm would again suggest no effect.",
                "One explanation for the apparent declining SOC levels at depth beneath the trees is a bulk density effect. This can be discounted however, as the higher bulk densities recorded in the agroforestry treatments (Fig. 4) would lead to greater rather than smaller volumetric SOC. A second explanation is that the difference is a result of preexperimental soil heterogeneity; perhaps the soil at this particular depth in the agroforestry plot has always had a lower level of soil carbon. Unfortunately we do not have data to indicate if this was or was not the case. However it is worth noting that other studies have also demonstrated that establishing trees on arable land can lead to declines in soil carbon at depth. Vesterdal and Ritter (2002) report that in a 30 year study of afforestation of former arable land in Denmark, the soil carbon content increased at 0 -5 cm, whilst there was a decrease at 15 -25 cm. Jug et al. (1999) in a study of short-rotation poplar plantations on arable land in Germany, also showed that the cessation of ploughing led to a tendency for soil carbon to decline at 30 cm. These two results may be explained by the cessation of ploughing which had formerly incorporated surface organic matter at depth. However in a 40 year study of forest re-establishment on former agricultural land in South Carolina in the USA, Richter et al. (1999) found that there was a significant increase in soil organic carbon in the top 7.5 cm of soil, but a significant decline between depths of 35 and 60 cm. Richter et al. (1999) proposed that the decline may be caused by the slow oxidation of previous organic matter associated with crops. It is also possible that increased water use by the trees could have resulted in greater soil aeration at depth and consequently greater respiration rates (Moore",
                "and Knowles 1989). Certainly the soil in the control plots was visually wetter than the soil under the trees.",
                "An alternative explanation is the ' priming effect ; ' where inputs of readily accessible carbon from root exudates and root deposition leads to a change in the composition of microbial and fungal communities towards those which favour decomposition of older, recalcitrant forms of soil carbon (Fontaine et al. 2007, 2011). Observing this effect, Carney et al. (2007), found in a free air carbon enrichment experiment, that 52% of aboveground gains in carbon storage were offset by ' priming effect ' induced carbon losses in the top 0 -10 cm of soil, in scrub oak in Florida.",
                "In the present study, there was insufficient replication of soil fractionation measurements to demonstrate whether the proportion of recalcitrant soil carbon (rSOC) at a depth of 83 cm under the trees (8.4%) was significantly lower than that under the control (10.9%). In fact, statistical analysis showed no treatment or depth effect on the proportion of chemically resistant soil organic carbon, 19 years after tree establishment."

                "Assuming that soil carbon over a depth of 1.5 m was similar in 1992, the non-significant difference in the soil carbon contents of the agroforestry and control treatments of 8.7 t C ha -1 after 19 years (Fig. 6), would be equivalent to an annual change of 0.46 t C ha -1 . However this non-significant change masks significant differences at individual depths. For example the annual rate would be equivalent to a gain of 0.77 t C ha 1 at 20 -40 cm, and a loss of 0.70 t C ha -1 at 60 -105 cm. Post and Kwon (2000) cite average annual changes of soil carbon from eight studies, following a change from agriculture to forestry in cool temperate regions, that range from a loss of 0.04 t C ha -1 to a gain of 0.66 t C ha -1 . For a 21-year-old poplar silvoarable system (111 trees ha -1 ) in Ontario, Canada, the mean annual soil carbon sequestration rate in the top 30 cm of a sandy loam soil was 0.30 t C ha -1 a -1 (Bambrick et al. 2010). The greater change in the surface layer at the Silsoe site may be due to the higher tree density (156 rather than 111 trees ha -1 ). In addition, the clay at the Silsoe site may be better suited to the accumulation of organic matter than the sandy-loam found at the Canadian site (Veen et al. 1985).",

                "This study affirms many of the methodological issues recently levelled against studies of carbon sequestration in agroforestry systems (Nair 2011). Chief among these is the question of depth: our results demonstrate that to get an accurate picture of the carbon sequestration potential of temperate agroforestry systems, soil sampling needs to be conducted to a greater depth than is routinely practiced. In this study, 64% and 41% of the total soil carbon detected was found below 20 and 40 cm respectively (relative to 1.5 m). This literal lack of depth in research is peculiar to temperate systems; Nair et al. (2009) cites seven studies of soil carbon in tropical agroforestry systems that conducted sampling to a depth of a metre or more -one at 2 m.",
                "Whilst temperate agroforestry systems undoubtedly store more carbon aboveground compared to conventional agricultural systems, the impact of tree planting on soil carbon at depth is important. Whilst this study indicates that poplar based agroforestry systems may accumulate soil carbon rapidly at shallow depths; they may also be responsible for a rapid loss of soil carbon deeper in the soil profile. Possible reasons for this are soil drying leading to oxidation, and the priming effect of new accessible carbon. Further study is needed to establish if this is a general effect which can be generalised over a range of sites.",
