# The Nature Conservancy Retrieval Augmented Large Language Model (RAG-LLM) Pipeline

  

This project was a collaboration between students from Harvey Mudd College's chapter of [Code the Change](https://codethechange.cs.hmc.edu/) and scientists from The Nature Conservancy.

  

For more information on this project, please check out our interim slide deck presentation, which is also in this repository folder.

 

If you're interested in learning more or have any questions, here are the cool people that worked on this project! (Note, the summer team worked primary on this pipeline a bit more than the spring team, so if you have any more technical questions, the summer team would be your best point of contact!)

## Repository Contents

-  `pdf_processing`: This folder contains the code to process new PDFs that you may want to add as retrieval context. It will convert the PDF to JSON format, which is necessary to pass through our RAG pipeline

-  `Summer_RAG`: This is the main folder you want to use for our pipeline. Detailed instructions for running the pipeline is included in the `README.md` file in this folder

-  `Spring_RAG`: This portion of the pipeline was built based off the Spring Code the Change's team's work. However, for best results and ease of use, please use the code and material from the Summer_RAG folder

  

## FAQ
**Does the pipeline use or include data from tables and figures?** - At this time, our pipeline is able to extract table information, but we're not yet utilizing data from figures. We hope to do so in the future.
