Different models viz., monomolicular, logistic, gompetz, allometric, rechards, chapman and linear were fitted to the relationship between total biomass and diameter at breast height (DBH) as independent variable. The adjusted R 2 values were more than 0.924 for all the seven models implying that all models are apparently equally efficient. Out of the six non-linear models, allometric model (Y = a 9 DBH ) fulfils the b validation criterion to the best possible extent and is thus considered as best performing. Biomass in different tree components was fitted to allometric models using DBH as explanatory variable, the adjusted R 2 for fitted functions varied from 0.872 to 0.965 for different biomass components. The t values for all the components were found non-significant (p [ 0.05), thereby indicating that model is valid.

                "Quantification of biomass and carbon storage has recently become important all over the world and is presently an important component in the implementation of the emerging carbon credit market mechanism (Brown 2002; Chave et al. 2004; Mugasha et al. 2013). A common framework and good practice guidance for carbon reporting through biomass equation has also been recognised by United nation (IPCC 2003). Quantification of biomass can be done by harvesting the trees, using stem volume information, biomass expansion factors or using biomass models. Biomass models are important tools for understanding the changes related to productivity, energy, stocks and fluxes of carbon and nutrients (Houghton 1991). Typically, biomass models comprise easily measureable tree",
                "variables such as diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height, canopy spread, etc. that are closely correlated to the biomass (Navar et al. 2004; Chave et al. 2005; Negash et al. 2013).",
                "Grewia optiva locally called as 'Beul' or 'Bhimal' is one of important agroforestry tree species grown by the farmers in the lower and mid-hill regions of western Himalaya in India. It is an important tree, which provides leaf fodder during the winters when no other green fodder is available. The calorific value of the tree is 4920 k cal kg -1 , which makes it a very good fuelwood tree and alternate source of energy (Joshi and Dhiman 1992). It also provides fibre and edible fruits, and is used medicinally. Besides producing valuable product, the species also provides indirect benefits including environmental services, such as soil and water conservation and carbon sequestration which play an important role in function of climate mitigation.",
                "In India, equations for estimating biomass have been developed mainly for short rotation and timber species such as Populus deltoides (Ajit et al. 2011; Rizvi et al. 2011), Eucalyptus (Ajit et al. 2000), Dalbergia sissoo (Lodhiyal and Lodhiyal 2003; Bohre et al. 2012), Tectona grandis (Buvaneswaran et al. 2006) and little attention has been paid for fodder and fuelwood species. In spite of huge nutritious fodder demand and importance of G. optiva in western Himalaya, studies related to biomass production and carbon sequestration in G. optiva are limited (Singh et al. 1997; Vishwanatham et al. 1999; Raizada and Singh 2010). Few predictive models for G. optiva have been previously developed in traditional agroforestry systems of western Himalaya (Gupta et al. 1990; Joshi and Dhiman 1992), which however, have limited application on degraded lands where large variabilities regarding soil topography and climate are observed. Further, these developed models are meant only for predicting leaf and branchwood biomass and does not include bole and roots, which mean that the models are not applicable to estimate total biomass and carbon stocks in the trees. Carbon storage in G. optiva is important as components like bole and roots are not harvested for long time and can store carbon for longer period. Therefore, the present study was designed to develop biomass models for estimation of biomass and carbon stocks in G optiva . plantations of different ages on degraded lands of Doon valley in western Himalaya."

The climate of the study area is sub-tropical with an average annual rainfall of 1625 mm. About 81 % of the total rainfall is received in 80 rainy days during the monsoon season between mid June to mid September. Occurrence of high intensity storms even exceeding 100 mm hr -1 is a common feature during the monsoon season leading to severe erosion problems. The mean maximum temperature of 37.2 /C176 C and mean minimum temperature of 3.8 /C176 Chave been recorded in the month of May and January, respectively.",

Trees varying from 4 to 23 years in age were distributed into six diameter classes of 2-5 , 5-8, 8-11, 11-14, 14-17 and 17-20 cm. Selective tree harvesting from each diameter class was adopted. In total, 25 trees were harvested. The felled trees were cut into 1-2 m logs. Root biomass was studied by excavating the roots in 1.5 m 3 volume of soil for each harvested tree. Roots were separated into tap roots and lateral roots. Fresh weight of each tree components (leaves, branchwood, bole and roots) were determined in the field. Samples of fresh components (500 g) were oven dried at 60 /C176 C until constant weight in the laboratory to determine moisture content (Lodhiyal et al. 1995; Usuga et al. 2010). Using dry/fresh weight factor, the dry weight was estimated for different tree components."

To get an idea of the shape of the function to be fitted on the data, a scatter plot of total biomass vs DBH was initially drawn. It was clear from this scatter plot that the candidate functions usually adopted for modeling total biomass-dbh curves viz., Monomolicular, Logistic, Gompetz, Allometric, Rechards, Chapman and Linear will fit well in the observed dataset. For validation, original dataset of 25 trees was randomly split into two mutually exclusive and pseudo-independent datasets; 17 for model estimation and the remaining eight trees for ''testing'' the models.

From each age group, 27 trees were measured for their diameter at breast height (diameter at 1.37 m). The diameter values of each tree in each age group were used in the developed model to obtain an estimate of biomass in different tree components. The respective biomass values in different components were multiplied by the tree density to obtain total biomass (Mg ha -1 ) in different age groups.",
                "Subsamples of different tree components were ground in a Wiley mill. A total of 50 % of the ashfree mass was taken as the carbon (C) content. The ash content was determined by igniting 1 g of powdered sample at 550 /C176 C for 6 h in a muffle furnace (Allen et al. 1989). Carbon stored in different tree components was obtained by multiplying the dry weight of the different components by their average carbon content.

Predictive models using one independent variable (DBH) are simple and do not require additional height measurement in the field for its application (Segura et al. 2006; Nath et al. 2009) and are thus less time consuming and cost effective than direct tree measurements (Araujo et al. 1999; Montes et al. 2000). Number of studies also indicated that biomass and carbon stock estimated from DBH without harvesting of the trees is reliable (Singh and Lodhiyal 2009;Rizvietal. 2011; Mugashaet al. 2013; Arora et al. 2013). Moreover the total height of the fodder trees is not reliable to measure because of continuous lopping. Further, it has been reported that there are no significant differences in the biomass estimated with (DBH) H or 2 with DBH as independent variable (Singh and Mishra 1995; Ajit et al. 2011). Harvesting of 25 trees covering entire range of available DBH for developing the relationship between biomass and DBH in the present study has been supported by Joshi and Dhiman (1992) and Ajit et al. (2011) as they have reported that detailed study of 15-30 plants covering the entire size variability is sufficient to formulate a valid equation for biomass estimation.",
                "The parameter estimates along with other related statistics of the different functions viz, monomolicular, logistic, Gompetz, allometric, Rechards, Chapman and Linear fitted on estimation dataset is presented in Table 2. The adjusted R 2 (observed vs predicted) values were more than 0.924 for all the seven models implying that all models are apparently equally efficient. However, R 2 value alone should not be used as criteria to judge the best fitting function (Prajneshu and Chandran 2005; Ajit et al. 2006; 2011). Validation and the behaviour of the fitted function inside and outside the observed range of the independent variable should also be given due consideration while selecting the best model. Out of the six non-linear models, allometric model (Y = a 9 DBH ) fulfils the validab tion criterions to the best possible extent (approaching closely the standard values) and was thus considered as best performing, though more than 96 % of the variance in measured biomass was explained by all six models. Linear model outperformed all other nonlinear models as it is most closely associated with the standard values of various criterions (Table 3). However, the linear model were not used for estimating the biomass as it suffers from the problem of negative estimation of size i.e., the predicted value of biomass comes out to be negative for the lower values of explanatory variable (Ajit et al. 2011). The assumption that the residual should be independently and normally distributed with mean zero and constant variance were evaluated through statistical analysis of total above ground biomass (AGB) (Fig. 1a, b). The independent and normality characteristics of the residuals of the regression model were also analysed. The normality of the residuals was tested using Anderson-Darling tests with the null hypothesis that the residuals are normally distributed. The test statistic for Anderson-Darling test was 0.648 (p = 0.075) which indicates the acceptance of the null hypothesis. The plots of",

Allometric model provided the best goodness-of-fit statistics, increasing statistical efficiency in biomass estimate. The cross-validation procedure indicated that the parameter values in models are stable and therefore, the models are reliable to predict biomass in G. optiva . However, models developed are only valid within the range of DBH covered during sampling and also they do not account for other source of variations in the study. Further it is concluded that large-scale G. optiva plantations on degraded lands can be helpful in reducing the pressure on forests for fodder and fuelwood besides providing the C storage benefits in the long term to mitigate the effect of climate change. The component wise biomass models developed in the present study are likely to be useful to the farmers in estimation of the standing biomass and carbon stock at any stage of tree growth and also to estimate additional revenue in terms of carbon credit.",
