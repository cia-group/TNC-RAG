# The Nature Conservancy Retrieval Augmented Large Language Model (RAG-LLM) Pipeline

  

This project was a collaboration between students from Harvey Mudd College's chapter of [Code the Change](https://codethechange.cs.hmc.edu/) and scientists from The Nature Conservancy.

  

For more information on this project, please check out our interim slide deck presentation, which is also in this repository folder.

 

If you're interested in learning more or have any questions, here are the cool people that worked on this project! (Note, the summer team worked primary on this pipeline a bit more than the spring team, so if you have any more technical questions, the summer team would be your best point of contact!)
