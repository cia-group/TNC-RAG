They store large quantities of carbon (C) in plants and the soil (Kaonga and Bayliss-Smith 2009; Soto-Pinto et al. 2010), sequester C from the atmosphere (IPCC 2007; Kaonga and Coleman 2008), contribute to protection of natural forest ecosystems (IPCC 2001; FAO 2002), and improve soil productivity (Kimaro et al. 2007; Jose 2009). Strategic C management in these tree-based",
                "ecosystems requires understanding the effects of different plant species on C capture and storage based on standardized data collection techniques (Brown et al. 2004; IPCC 2006). However, data on vegetal and soil organic carbon (SOC) pools and fluxes for most agroforestry systems are lacking because reliable methods for estimating the ecosystem C pools are scarce.",
                "Biomass estimates are useful for quantifying net primary productivity, energy pathways, nutrient and C cycles, harvestable biomass yields, and in evaluating habitats and combustible fuels (Saint-Andre ´ et al. 2005; Delitti et al. 2006). The most accurate method for estimation of plant biomass and changes in C stocks for a stand is through periodic destructive harvesting (Brown et al. 2004; Basuki et al. 2009). However, cutting and weighing a sufficient number of trees to represent the size and species distribution in an ecosystem is complex, time consuming, tedious, and labor intensive (Delitti et al. 2006). Similarly, measuring SOC pools and their fluxes is difficult because of enormous spatial variations in C densities, even at plot level (Morisada et al. 2004; Kaonga and Bayliss-Smith 2009). In addition, SOC data for many regions are scarce because soil analyses are costly, time-consuming, and labor-intensive (Liski et al. 2002; Reum et al. 2009). Where data from long-term experiments are available, ecosystem models can be useful for estimating plant and soil C stocks and fluxes (Falloon and Smith 2002; Kaonga and Coleman 2008) and in assessing the impact of various environmental and ecosystem management scenarios.",
                "The CO2FIX model has been used to estimate the dynamics of C stocks and flows for a variety of ecosystems around the world (Schelhaas et al. 2004). It is an invaluable tool that has contributed to IPCC climate assessments and estimation of C implications in the context of the Kyoto Protocol (Gaboury et al. 2009). The CO2FIX model thus holds great promise for improving impact assessments of ecosystembased mitigation of, and adaptation, to climate change through agroforestry. However, this model has not been tested using empirical data from a variety of agroforestry systems and especially from the tropics.",

The sampling procedure was derived from methods of Kumar and Tewari (1999). Before selecting the trees for destructive sampling, total tree height (H) and diameter at breast height (DBH) measurements of all trees in each plot were taken to assess intra-specific variability in the plot. This variable is used to select sample trees to ensure that they adequately represent the diameter and height classes above and below the stand/plot average. It is also used to determine the appropriate sample size to reduce sampling error by including sufficient number of trees from different diameter classes. Each randomly selected tree, cut 10 cm above the soil surface, was manually partitioned into stems, branches, twigs, and leaves. The stem sub-sample comprised discs (5 cm thick) at 0, 40, and 70% of tree height. After weighing individual fractions of each sampled tree, representative samples were collected for C analysis, fraction-wise. Total biomass of a sample tree was calculated by adding dry weights of all components, and stocks were expressed as Mg C ha -1 . Means of 20 sample plants per species were used for subsequent statistical analyses. A default conversion factor of 0.26 times aboveground tree C stocks was used to calculate the root C stocks (IPCC 2003).

Other sources of variations possibly include roots and/or dissolved organic C (DOC) transport which substantially contributes to a Decadally-Reactive Soil C Pool (Baisden and Parfitt 2004) from previous vegetation, and redistribution of SOC due cultivation for commercial maize production (Chintu et al. 2004) predating woodlot establishment. Several tillage/C sequestration studies have shown that root length densities and SOC stocks in tilled soils were greater at deeper depths (Dolan et al. 2006; Baker et al.",

                "2007), and deep root systems associated with tree legumes deposit C at depth (Mendham et al., 2003). Fractionation and soil aggregate hierarchy studies backed by C dating could explain soil C dynamics in these soils.",

                "The capacity of the CO2Fix model to simulate aboveground tree C stocks differed across tree parts (Table 3). Modeled stem C stocks (16.3-17.5 Mg ha -1 ) closely matched measured stocks (17.119.5 Mg ha -1 ), with a mean percentage bias of 7%. Similarly, there was a strong agreement between measured total aboveground C stocks (24.4-33.2 Mg ha -1 ) and modeled stocks (23.5-30.6 Mg ha -1 ) resulting in a 9% bias, presumably because the stem biomass constitutes the largest portion of aboveground biomass for most species. By contrast, the model underestimated branch and leaf C stocks by 29 and 39%, respectively. The degree of convergence between measured and modeled stocks was stronger for stem and total aboveground biomass than for branches and leaves because the CAI values were determined using stem diameter measurements, while the CO2FIX model generated annual biomass allocation coefficients for foliage and branches relative to stems, and (ii) senescence of leaves and branches introduces variance in fractional allocation coefficients. Therefore, the model accurately predicted stem and total aboveground C stocks, but estimates of tree C stocks could be improved through long-term data collection.",
                "There were variations in degrees of convergence between measured and modeled tree component (stem, branches, and leaves) carbon stocks across species. Measured stem C stocks of L. leucocephala (17.1 Mg ha -1 ) and L. macrophylla (17.6 Mg ha -1 ) closely matched modeled stocks, with percentage bias of less than 1%. By contrast, the model underestimated stem C stocks of L. diversifolia and L. collinsii by 16 and 11%, respectively. Percentage bias values ranged from 2 to 19% for total aboveground C stocks, 22-40% for branches, and 22-62% for leaves. Therefore, the model more accurately estimated stem C stocks than branch and leaf stocks.",
                "Agroforestry research in southern Africa has not generated sufficient data to simulate C stocks in woodlots accurately. For example, inputs of wood density, CAI, and annual biomass allocation coefficients of tree components relative to stem biomass were required for tree species in the woodlot, but very limited data were available. Use of default, proxy, or published values derived from other studies reduces the predictive power of the model because such values might have intrinsic uncertainties, which are propagated through the model. Model parameters and inputs might vary with environmental conditions, geographic location, and time (Bo ¨ttcher et al. 2008). Despite limitations in long-term climatic and tree growth data, the CO2FIX model simulated stem and total aboveground C stocks that closely matched measured stocks in woodlots. Therefore, the model",

                "Table 3 shows mean values of organic C content and bulk density of soils from Leucaena treatments at Msekera in eastern Zambia. Soil organic C density decreased with increasing soil depth across tree species, presumably because much of the litterfall and root decomposition to SOC in tree-based land use systems happens in the upper soil layers. Biological activities, which are more pronounced in the surface layers than in the subsoil, enhance physical and chemical protection of SOC in soil aggregates. As a result, mean soil bulky density values increased with increasing depth in all Leucaena treatments.",
                "Modeled SOC stocks (45.1-53.3 Mg ha -1 ) at 100 cm depth in Leucaena woodlots at Msekera were 2.2-3.4 times lower than measured stocks (109.3-169 Mg ha -1 ) (Table 4) presumably because (i) soil bulk density values for the 25-200 cm were derived from other studies, and (ii) the soil module does not adequately predict bulk density changes due to cumulative effects of annual litter inputs. Oelbermann and Voroney (2011) observed that the Century model underestimated simulated values in the alley cropping systems compared to measured values due to the inability of the model to account for changes in soil bulk density with increasing organic matter inputs with tree age from prunings or litterfall. In addition, the soil C module of the CO2FIX model could not estimate SOC stocks presumably because several factors affected the fit of the model to experimental data. First, woodlots were established on land that was previously used for traditional maize production, suggesting that soils were disturbed and probably not in equilibrium. Model calibrations to current SOC stocks that assume equilibrium state when soils are in a transient state may overestimate decomposition rates of the slowest pools (Wutzler and Reichstein 2006; Bo ¨ttcher et al. 2008). Moreover, roots and/or dissolved organic C from previous vegetation contribute to a Decadally-Reactive Deep Soil Carbon Pool (Baisden and Parfitt 2004), which must be adequately accounted for.",

Applying these regressions to describe intra-location differences in decomposition due to annual climatic variability assumes short-term acclimatization of the decomposer community to changing environmental conditions is similar to differences among different communities genetically adapted to different geographical gradients. Finally, although the model assumes that decomposition rates are uniform across the 0-100 cm soil profile, oxidation of SOM declines with increasing depth. These factors might have introduced sampling, recording, and analytical errors that contributed to underestimation of SOC stocks. Therefore, the results of testing the soil module of the CO2FIX using soil carbon data form woodlots at Msekera in Zambia are inconclusive at this stage. Further studies to generate more inputs for model parameterization are needed."

                "Assessment of the effects of five Leucaena tree species on above- and below-ground tree C stocks in woodlots showed that L. pulverulenta had significantly larger above- and below-ground C stocks, and MAI of total aboveground stocks, than other Leucaena species. Carbon capture and storage in tree biomass through establishment of Leucaena woodlots can be maximized through planting selected species with high biomass yields and MAI.",
                "Although large variations in measured SOC densities were observed across species, the actual contribution of species to these densities could not be determined. However, SOC stocks in L. leucocephala and L. collinsii plots were substantially greater than those of other species. Better understanding of soil C densities and their distribution in the 0-200 cm soil profile could be enhanced through fractionation and soil aggregate studies backed by carbon dating.",
                "Evaluation of the CO2Fix model as a tool for estimation of C stocks using data from woodlots showed that measured stem and total aboveground C stocks were closely matched to modeled stocks. The degrees of convergence between measured and modeled stocks were stronger for stem, branches and total aboveground biomass than leaves. Therefore, the CO2Fix model can be used to accurately estimate changes in stem and total aboveground tree C stocks in woodlots.",
                "The soil module of the CO2Fix model could not estimate SOC stocks presumably because of inadequate long-term empirical data on climate, litter quality, and quantity, and tree growth, and the transient nature of SOC stocks in fields that were disturbed in recent decades. Therefore, the results of testing the CO2FIX using soil C data from woodlots at Msekera are inconclusive at this stage. The module can be used only for estimating changes in aboveand belowground tree C stocks in woodlots until soil C module is proven to accurately predict SOC stocks in eastern Zambia. The study underlines the need for long-term data collection to generate more inputs for model parameterization.",
