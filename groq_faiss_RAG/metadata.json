Live fences in livestock systems also decrease diurnal and seasonal fluctuations of soil CO2 emissions. Agroforestry enhances food production while meeting sustainable development goals. It sequesters atmospheric carbon, as seen in China's agroforestry systems. Soil organic matter is determined using methods like Walkley-Black and Degtjareff."
