                "Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD ) is receiving increasing political + and scientific attention as a climate change mitigation approach. Agroforestry systems are credited for stocking significant amounts of carbon and hence have a potential to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Forestry-based carbon storage projects are currently being introduced in many tropical countries, but assessment of carbon storage is difficult due to a lack of species-level information.The research addressed in this paper assessed above, belowground and litter biomass of Theobroma cacao (cocoa) and Tectona grandi s(teak) plantations relative to secondary forests in two sites in mid-western Côte d'Ivoire. Allometric equations for tropical trees relating to diameter at breast height (DBH) were used to estimate carbon storage potential. The mainfindings reveal that teak plantations have an appreciably much greater mean carbon storage capacity than secondary forests and cocoa plantations. The aboveground biomass of teak stands contained the highest carbon stock (214.7 Mg C ha -1 ) while litter and root displayed 2.8 and 35.6 Mg C ha -1 , respectively. Cocoa plantations have the lowest carbon storage potential in the aboveground biomass,estimated at 18.6 Mg C ha -1 , but a considerable amount of carbon stored in the litter (4.7 Mg C ha -1 ). With teak plantations ' annual mean storage rate of 19.5 Mg C ha -1 year -1 , corresponding to 70.6 Mg CO2 ha -1 year -1 , the results demonstrate teak's potential of carbon sequestration and mitigation of the greenhouse gas emission effect.",

                "Like all tropical countries whose economy relies on the exploitation of natural resources, Côte d Ivoire may face serious ' deforestation and forest degradation leading to biodiversity lost and soil quality deterioration (Tondoh et al., 2015). Indeed, several studies (Dao,1999; Brou et al., 2005; Tondoh et al., 2015) show that for decades, deforestation in Côte d Ivoire has reached an alarming ' rate; about 4/5 of the country s forests have been disappearing at a ' rate of 7.6% per year over the last three decades (Balac, 1999). One of the root causes of deforestation is the development of cash tree crop plantations, such as cocoa ( Theobroma cacao , Sterculiaceae) and coffee ( Coffea arabusta and Coffea canephora , Rubiaceae). Such plantations have led to the degradation of 83% of the forests, with remaining forests in 1996 estimated at 2.5 million left of 15 million hectares in the early 1960 s (Ruf, 1997; Lanly, 1982; Païvinen et al., 0",
                "1992). On the other hand, Côte d Ivoire has been the world s top ' ' cocoa producer for the last 50 years, with a 40% share of the global market, followed by Ghana, Nigeria and Cameroon (Gockowski and Sonwa, 2011; Hartemink, 2005). The increase of area under cocoa plantation has been at the expense of Guinea rain forest cover, with over 2.3 million ha of deforestation and forest degradation associated with this widespread land-use system (Gockowski and Sonwa, 2011).",
                "In order to counteract this trend of forest cover reduction and soil deterioration, and as part of its strategy for protecting biodiversity and promoting sustainable management of forests, the government recommended enriching spare lands spread throughout the country, called ' Forêts Classées , ' by planting native and exotic tree species (SODEFOR, 2002). Such a program was executed in the ' Forêt Classée de la Téné ' located in the central-western part of the country, Department of Oumé, where planting fast growing exotic species ( Tectona grandis , teak) along with local species such as Terminalia superba ; Terminalia ivorensis , Gmelina arborea , was carried out. Teak has highly valued, light but strong timber, with a natural resistance against termites and other",

                "insects, and wood-degrading fungi (FAO, 2000; Bhat and Gnanaharan, 2007; Derwisch et al., 2009). Because of their high economic value, teak and cocoa were the most common cash tree crops planted by smallholder farmers in the study area with cocoa and teak stands covering the whole landscape at the expense of natural forest. In the current context of climate change, however, documenting such plantations ' contribution to environmental services such as carbon sequestration will provide useful information as to how much they might contribute to the country s REDD + ' program.",
                "In addition to their contribution to improving smallholders ' livelihoods, the establishment of teak and cocoa plantations could be seen as a management strategy for storing quantities of carbon and thus mitigating climate change. In order to evaluate their potential contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emission, it is crucial to evaluate the baseline situation by assessing carbon stocks within both plantations using the most relevant scientific methods. The objectives of this study were to (i) determine the stocks and accumulation rates of carbon in teak and cocoa stands with reference to adjacent secondary forests, and (ii) estimate the distribution of carbon stocks in different pools (aboveground, litter, and roots). We hypothesized that the conversion of forest into cocoa and teak plantations would lead to a great variation in above and belowground carbon storage, and that teak plantations would be the best option to store carbon in the biomass and therefore mitigate CO2 emissions. Results of this study would help establish baseline data on carbon sequestration for cocoa and teak plantations, which might play a key role in REDD + strategy in Côte d Ivoire. '"

                "The present study was carried out in a semi-deciduous forest area located in the Centre-West Region of Côte d Ivoire (6 30N ' /C14 latitude, 5 31W longitude). In the 1970s, this area, as part of the /C14 main cocoa production area, was characterized by a high rate of deforestation. As a result, the landscape is now composed of a mosaic of land-uses, including forests, old cocoa and teak plantations, and other native tree species which are part of the ' Forêt Classée de la Téné . Cocoa stands are spread around two ' settlements, Petit Bouaké and Mafia, each located about 2 km from the main village of Goulikao. These settlements are occupied exclusively by farmers who migrated from the country s savanna ' areas seeking arable lands for cocoa farming. The slash and burn agricultural land-use system consists of a mixture of cash and subsistence crops with fallow as an intermediary step for soil regeneration. Food crops such as plantains ( Musa spp.) are mixed with cocoa trees until 5 years of age with the aim of having, ultimately, a cocoa plantation.",
                "The climate is subequatorial with four seasons: a long dry season, from November to February; a long wet season, from March to June; a short dry season, from July to August and a short wet season, from September to October. Rainfall for the study year was about 1444.1mm. The average monthly temperature was about 26.3 /C14 C with a low monthly variability of 1.6 /C14 C. Soils are ferralsols, with a sandy-loam texture (Assié et al., 2008). Soils pH varied between 6.3 and 7.3."

The cocoa and teak trees selected were 26 and 13 years old, respectively, as there were enough replicates of these ages in the landscape for statistical analysis. According to a survey of farmers, the secondary forests were approximately 55 years old at Mafia and 60 at Petit-Bouaké. The cocoa plantations and secondary forests covered 2 and 2.5 ha in the different research areas (Table 1), while the teak plantations, the most extensive land-use type in the area, covered 12.4 ha in Petit-Bouaké, and 36.1 ha in Mafia.",
                "The two general sample plot designs applicable in forest inventories for the purposes of biomass and carbon assessments are single plot and nested plot. The former is appropriate for monoculture plantations, homogenous in tree size and distribution, and, in most cases, single storeyed. The latter, usually used for forest carbon assessments, are appropriate for inventories in natural forests with high variability in tree size, distribution and structure (Ekoungoulou et al., 2015). Nested plot designs require variable size subplots for both different tree size classes, and different forest carbon pools (Brown, 2005). In order to determine the quantity of different biomasses and assess carbon stocks in different types of land use, a full nested plot design of four quadrats was used for the secondary forest sample plots, and a limited nested plot design of two quadrats for the plantation sample plots. This design yielded twelve clusters of three nested quadrats per plot, for a total of 72 clusters in six plots across the study area scale: two each of forest, teak and cocoa in each study site. The clusters were separated from each other by 100 -150m to account for spatial heterogeinty (Fig. 1b)."

                "3.1. Changes in above and belowground C stock beneath teak plantations",
                "The biomass stocks of teak ( Tectona grandis ) stands have been subjected to extensive research in the past two decades because of their importance in the global carbon mitigation strategy (Pérez and Kanninen, 2003; Derwisch et al., 2009; Shulka and Viswanath, 2014). The study showed that the 13-year-old teak plantations had +20%moreCstockthan thesecondary forests. Thisfinding could be explained by the high planting density of teak (1700 individuals ha-1 ), which allows for morefixation of carbon with similar volumes of individual biomass (Shulka and Viswanath, 2014). Improved soil properties, characterized by good drainage and a pH value ranging between 6.3 to 7.3 provide ideal conditions for better growth of Tectona grandis (Kasoa-ard, 1981, 1998; Tanaka et al., 1998; Takahashi et al., 2009). Changes in tree plantations ' biomass and carbon stocks might be affected by planting density and sites characteristics, which in turn affected plant growth and the DBH (Eamus et al., 2000; Ofori-Frimpong et al., 2010). Management practices also in fl uence biomass production and allocation within trees in the landscape. For example, variations in coppicing (e.g., teak stands) may affect the rate of biomass accumulation after cutting (Keith et al., 2000; Kuyah et al., 2012), and pruning can change biomass without affecting the DBH. Although, forest tree density (1900 individuals ha-1 ) is higher than in teak plantations, so the high carbon stocks in teak plantations as compared to forest ecosystems could be explained by the predominance of species with DBH < 5cm. This statement is in line with previous studies, which showed that tree species carbon content is positively correlated with the diameter at breast height (Kraenzel et al., 2003; Segura et al., 2005b; Litton and Kauffman, 2008; Ekoungoulou et al., 2014).",
                "In forest and teak plantations, most of the carbon was accumulated in the wood, followed by the roots and leaves. The trend in C concentration observed in aboveground biomass is consistent with observations made by Jain and Ansari (2013) in India who showed that timber trees ( Tectona grandis ) mostly accumulated carbon in their trunks as compared to others pools.",
                "3.2. Modification in above and belowground C stock of cocoa plantations",
                "Unlike teak plantations, secondary forests ' conversion into fullsun cocoa plantations resulted in marked decrease (89%) in total carbon stock, which was found in Indonesia to be close to 75 -88% (Stephan-Dewenter et al., 2007; Smiley and Kroschel, 2008). Somarriba et al. (2013) found similar results in Costa Rica. The drop in carbon stock in cocoa stands could be explained by their monospecific composition of trees with modest height and small DBH, in contrast to forests composed of multispecies trees which with fairly important height and DBH. Moreover, because cocoa trees allocate a large part of their resources to the production of pods, which will be later harvested for marketing, these man-made"

                "Litters and roots are usually neglected in most studies (Chave et al., 2004; Sarmiento et al., 2005; Fonseca et al., 2011). However, our study showed that these two pools accumulated the largest amount of carbon in cocoa plantations as compared to forest and teak plantations. The positive relationship between litter height and carbon stock revealed that forest disturbance increased carbon stock due mainly to the accumulation of litter on the soil. Although the forest and teak litters were estimated at 1.5% of the total carbon in their biomasses, cocoa litter made up 17% of its total carbon stock, evidencing the importance of such a pool for carbon storage, as supported by Ofori-Frimpong et al. (2010). As confirmed by Dawoe et al. (2010) in Ghana, a 30-year-old cocoa plantation exhibited higher annual litterfall production compared to the forest system, but rates of decomposition for all litter types were considerably slower in the cocoa system than in the forest site. Some authors (Swift et al., 1979; Lavelle et al., 1993) have shown that litter decomposition rates vary markedly since they can be modified mainly by rainfall patterns, soil N status, soil fauna and litter quality.",

                "The largest new carbon store, after the establishment of the plantation, is the trees themselves (Kraenzel et al., 2003). In this study, we observed higher carbon accumulation rate in teak plantation corresponding to highest rate of CO2fixation than other land-use types. Thirteen years after teak plantation establishment, higher carbon accumulation rate was mainly coming from the trees faster growth hence its important rate of CO2fixation. Despite differences in methodologies and environmental conditions, Bohre et al. (2013) reported similar results in 19 years of growth for a teak plantation in India with 18.59 Mg C ha-1 year-1 of carbon content and 68.16 Mg CO2-eq. ha-1 year-1 mean annual CO2 rate accumulation. The differences in carbon accumulation rate and CO2fixation between different land-use types were due to their different growth rates and the ages of the different plantations."

                "As hypothesized, replacement of natural forests by monoculture plantations resulted in variation of carbon in aboveground, root and total biomasses. Teak plantations displayed the most promising storage capacity, much greater than forests and cocoa plantations. Aboveground biomass (214.7 Mg ha-1 ) is key to estimating the potential of teak plantations for carbon sequestration. Cocoa plantations showed the lowest carbon storage potential in ABG, but have a considerable carbon stock in the litter (4.7 Mg C ha-1 ). Ourfindings led to the conclusion that teak plantations are the main source of carbon storage in Oumé region and could therefore be included in REDD + strategy of the country. The country could consider the importance of using enrichment planting based on teak for the afforestation of degraded forest as already started in the Forêts Classées of Côte d Ivoire. The fact that ' farmers have been intensly sensitized in such practices on their own lands is encouraging."
